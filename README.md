Checkout in a folder below irrlicht/examples
Copy any of source-files and rename it to main.cpp to get it compiling with the project files. 

### What is this repository for? ###

Code snippets around the Irrlicht 3D engine. This project exists mainly to help me to keep my code snippets synchronized.

If you find anything useful in it feel free to use this code (it's zlib-licensed, but if you need another license I can add that - or just use it, I won't sue you).
