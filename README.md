### What is this repository for? ###

Code snippets, tests and experiments around the Irrlicht 3D engine.

If you find anything useful in it feel free to use this code. It's zlib-licensed, but if you need another license I can usually add that, I don't care, it's just meant to be used without worries. Some files are coded by others, in which case it's mentioned in the sources.

### USAGE ###

Checkout the repository into a folder below irrlicht/examples  
Copy any of the source files in the repository and rename it to main.cpp to get it compiling with the project files.
